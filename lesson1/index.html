     alt="Simpson family">
<p><b>The Simpsons</b> are the main protagonists of the TV show The Simpsons. The family first appeared on The Tracey Ullman
    Show, in the comedy short Good Night. The family has hundreds of relatives, including Mr. Burns and Patty and
    Selma.
    <br>
    The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer
    James L. Brooks. He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members,
    substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to
    "simpleton".<sup>[4]</sup> The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After three
    seasons, the
    sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in
    a season (1989â€“1990).
    <br>
    Since its debut on December 17, 1989, 740 episodes of the show have been broadcast. It is the longest-running
    American animated series, longest-running American sitcom, and the longest-running American scripted primetime
    television series, both in terms of seasons and number of episodes. A feature-length film, The Simpsons Movie, was
    released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million, with a sequel in development as of
    2018. The series has also spawned numerous comic book series, video games, books, and other related media, as well
    as a billion-dollar merchandising industry. The Simpsons is a joint production by Gracie Films and 20th
    Television.<sup>[5]</sup> On March 3, 2021, the series was announced to have been renewed for seasons 33 and
    34,<sup>[6]</sup> which were
    later confirmed to have 22 episodes each,<sup>[7]</sup> increasing the episode count from 706 to 750. Its thirty-third season
    premiered on September 26, 2021 and ended on May 22, 2022. The thirty-fourth season premiered on September 25,
    2022.<sup>[8]</sup>

<h2><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Simpson" target="_blank">Lisa Simpson</a></h2>
<img src="images/lisa.png" alt="Lisa">
<p><b>Lisa Marie Simpson</b> (born May 9, 1983)<sup>[9]</sup> is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson
    family and one of the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.
    <br>
    In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called Lil'
    Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of
    the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family.
    In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing
    saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity
    is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on
    her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ
    of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out at those who she deems lower than her or even
    above her. She has extreme jealousy from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the
    smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things
    through.</p>
